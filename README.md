# PHPBB3-Github-ServiceHook
A service hook for Github, it posts a topic for each new commit.

## Getting started
Upload this to your server where your forum is located. Edit the top three variables to your liking. I'd recommend renaming the file, too.

Once that's done, go to your repo: `Settings -> Service Hooks -> WebHook URLs`

Here you enter the URL of the file you just uploaded and save. Wollah! All new commits should now generate a topic.
